# Vending Machine Sales Analysis in Central New Jersey (2022)
## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data analytics process, focusing on vending machine sales data from four distinct locations in Central New Jersey, USA, covering the period from January 1 to December 31, 2022. The project progresses through dataset preparation, data cleaning, in-depth analysis, and visualization, culminating in the creation of a final dashboard website. The analysis aims to address specific business problems derived from the sales data, providing actionable insights for optimizing vending machine operations.

## Project Overview
This project is a collaborative effort aimed at analyzing real-life vending machine sales data to identify business challenges and derive insights that can enhance operational efficiency. The project is structured as follows:
- **Understanding the Dataset**: Gaining familiarity with the sales data across four locations and exploring potential avenues for analysis.
- **Business Problem Definition**: Identifying and articulating key business problems that need to be addressed through data-driven insights.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Ensuring the dataset is free of inconsistencies and ready for detailed analysis.
- **Analysis and Insights**: Conducting SQL-based analysis to answer specific business questions.
- **Visualization and Communication**: Visualizing the results in a manner that is both comprehensible and impactful.
  
## Dataset
The dataset consists of sales records from vending machines located at four distinct locations in Central New Jersey, USA. The data spans a full year from January 1 to December 31, 2022, and includes information such as item sales, location, time of purchase, and revenue generated. The dataset is stored in BigQuery for analysis and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awesomeasingh/vending-machine-sales).

## Visualization
After completing the analysis, the insights are visualized using Looker Studio. These visualization can be found [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3031178d-1a4f-4941-92f8-22c3b86623e0/page/Ud9uD).

## Next Steps: Software Engineering
The project now transitions into the software engineering phase, where the focus shifts from analysis to implementation. The cleaned and analyzed data will be exported from BigQuery as a .json file and used to develop a dashboard website. This phase involves:
- **Dashboard Development**: Building an interactive, user-friendly dashboard using web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and relevant libraries such as Chart.js.
- **Visualization Integration**: Incorporating the Looker Studio visualizations into the dashboard to effectively present the data insights.
- **User Experience Optimization**: Ensuring the final dashboard is intuitive, responsive, and communicates insights effectively to stakeholders.
