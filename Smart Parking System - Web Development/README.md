## Parking List Interface

The following image shows the user interface for viewing the list of available parking spots. This interface allows users to see a comprehensive list of parking spaces that are currently available for reservation. The list view provides clear information on which spots are categorized into:
- **Available** (Booked: No, Status: No): Spots currently open for reservation.
- **Booked** (Booked: Yes, Status: No): Spots that have been reserved.
- **Not Available** (Booked: Yes, Status: Yes): Spots that are not accessible or occupied.

## Parking Area Overview

In addition to the list view, the system provides an overview of the parking area. The image below shows the layout of the parking area, highlighting different zones and locations where parking spots are available, booked, or not available. The parking area also visualizes real-time time information, allowing users to see the current status and availability of parking spots dynamically.

By integrating both the list view and the area overview, users can efficiently find and reserve parking spots based on their preferences and the parking layout.
